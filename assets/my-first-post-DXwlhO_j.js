<h2 id="long-time-no-see">Long Time No See</h2>
<p>It&#39;s been a while since my last blog update. Life has kept me busy with work and various projects, but I&#39;m thrilled to be back and eager to share my journey with you. I&#39;ve been working extensively with Angular, and while I&#39;m still honing my skills, I&#39;ve gained valuable experience through home projects and experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-custom-ui-component-library">Building a Custom UI Component Library</h2>
<p>One of the most rewarding projects I&#39;ve tackled recently is the creation of a custom UI component library for Angular, inspired by the <a href="https://daisyui.com/">daisyUI</a> library for <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. While building such a library can be challenging, it&#39;s also incredibly fulfilling. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of templating, styling, and the Angular component lifecycle. With these new skills, I feel more confident than ever in my ability to take on any project. Though there&#39;s always more to learn, I&#39;m excited to continue growing and improving.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-use-my-custom-library-in-my-next-project">Should I Use My Custom Library in My Next Project?</h2>
<p>The short answer? Probably not. While custom libraries can be powerful, there are plenty of excellent UI libraries out there that are well-maintained, thoroughly documented, and open-source, like <a href="https://primeng.org/">primeng</a>. For small to medium-sized teams, particularly those in product development, it&#39;s usually more efficient to leverage existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. This allows you to focus on what truly matters: the business logic and user experience of your application.</p>
<h2 id="enter-analog-the-angular-meta-framework">Enter Analog: The Angular Meta-Framework</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I stumbled upon <a href="https://analogjs.org/">Analog</a> while searching for an Angular blog template. I had previously attempted to create my own blog template but had to put it on hold due to time constraints. Thankfully, I&#39;ve recently found the time to revisit this project, and setting up a blog with the Analog template was a breeze. Analog, of course, is not a blog template, it&#39;s a meta-framework that allows you to build Angular applications quickly and efficiently by providing a set of pre-built components, services, and utilities like <a href="https://angular.io/guide/ssr">SSR</a>, <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering">SSG</a>, <a href="https://analogjs.org/docs/features/routing/overview">file based routing</a>, and more. Like what Next.js is to React, Analog is to Angular.</p>
