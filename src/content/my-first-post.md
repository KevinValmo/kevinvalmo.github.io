## Long Time No See

It's been a while since my last blog update. Life has kept me busy with work and various projects, but I'm thrilled to be back and eager to share my journey with you. I've been working extensively with Angular, and while I'm still honing my skills, I've gained valuable experience through home projects and experimentation.

## Building a Custom UI Component Library

One of the most rewarding projects I've tackled recently is the creation of a custom UI component library for Angular, inspired by the [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) library for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). While building such a library can be challenging, it's also incredibly fulfilling. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of templating, styling, and the Angular component lifecycle. With these new skills, I feel more confident than ever in my ability to take on any project. Though there's always more to learn, I'm excited to continue growing and improving.

## Should I Use My Custom Library in My Next Project?

The short answer? Probably not. While custom libraries can be powerful, there are plenty of excellent UI libraries out there that are well-maintained, thoroughly documented, and open-source, like [primeng](https://primeng.org/). For small to medium-sized teams, particularly those in product development, it's usually more efficient to leverage existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. This allows you to focus on what truly matters: the business logic and user experience of your application.

## Enter Analog: The Angular Meta-Framework

A few months ago, I stumbled upon [Analog](https://analogjs.org/) while searching for an Angular blog template. I had previously attempted to create my own blog template but had to put it on hold due to time constraints. Thankfully, I've recently found the time to revisit this project, and setting up a blog with the Analog template was a breeze. Analog, of course, is not a blog template, it's a meta-framework that allows you to build Angular applications quickly and efficiently by providing a set of pre-built components, services, and utilities like [SSR](https://angular.io/guide/ssr), [SSG](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering), [file based routing](https://analogjs.org/docs/features/routing/overview), and more. Like what Next.js is to React, Analog is to Angular.
